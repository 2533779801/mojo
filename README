Back in the early days of the web there was this wonderful Perl library called
CGI, many people only learned Perl because of it.
It was simple enough to get started without knowing much about the language
and powerful enough to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun.
While most of the techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is
not.
Mojo is a new attempt at implementing this idea using state of the art
technology.

Features:

    * An amazing MVC web framework called Mojolicious, which supports a
      simplified single file mode through Mojolicious::Lite.

    * Very clean and Object Oriented pure Perl API without any hidden magic
      and no requirements besides Perl 5.8.1.

    * Full stack HTTP 1.1 and WebSocket client/server implementation with
      IPv6 and TLS support.

    * Builtin async IO and prefork web server with epoll and kqueue support,
      perfect for embedding.

    * CGI, FastCGI and PSGI support.

    And much more for you to discover!
