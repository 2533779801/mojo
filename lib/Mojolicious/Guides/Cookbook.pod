=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Guides::Cookbook - Cookbook

=head1 OVERVIEW

Cooking with L<Mojolicious>, recipes for every taste.

=head1 DEPLOYMENT

Getting L<Mojolicious> and L<Mojolicious::Lite> applications running on
different platforms.

=head2 Builtin Server

L<Mojolicious> contains a very portable HTTP 1.1 compliant web server.
It is usally used during development but is solid and fast enough for small
to mid sized applications.

    % ./script/myapp daemon
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

It has many configuration options and is known to work on every platform
Perl works on.

    % ./script/myapp help daemon
    ...List of available options...

Another huge advantage is that it supports WebSockets out of the box.

=head1 FUN

Hacks that might not be very useful but are fun! :)

=head2 Hello World

If every byte matters this is the smallest C<Hello World> application you can
write with L<Mojolicious::Lite>.

    use Mojolicious::Lite;
    get '/' => {text => 'Hello World!'};
    app->start;

It works because automatic rendering works even if no actual code gets
executed by the router, the renderer just picks up the C<text> value from the
stash.
