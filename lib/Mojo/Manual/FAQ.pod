=head1 QUESTIONS

=head2 Do i have to use L<Mojo::Base>?

Absolutely not, you could just use any other accessor generator in your
modules, L<Mojo::Base> is just a base class and will stay out of your way.

=head2 Do i have to use L<Mojo::Template>?

Not at all, it is just a convenient default option and can be replaced with
any other template engine out there.
